# Project Images

Place your project card images in this folder with the following naming convention:

- `mysweetie.png` - MySweetie.ai project image
- `billi-voice.png` - Billi VAPI Architecture project image
- `meetjeeves.png` - MeetJeeves.ai project image
- `ehb-bot.png` - EHB Knowledge Bot project image
- `tpe-field-agent.png` - The Payments Expert Agent project image
- `hospitality-ai-dashboard.png` - Hospitality AI Analytics Dashboard project image

## Image Recommendations

- **Format**: PNG
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 works well (the cards will crop to fit)
- **Recommended Size**: 800x600px or larger
- **Optimization**: Consider compressing images for faster loading

Images are referenced from the root path (e.g., `/images/mysweetie.png`), so they'll work both locally and when deployed to Vercel.
